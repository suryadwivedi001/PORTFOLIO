Problem Statement</h2><p class='section-intro'>Our bank's long‑standing Loan Origination System (NetOxygen) was designed for mortgages and consumer loans, but it wasn't built for credit cards or modern digital channels.</p><p>The existing system presented several critical challenges that were hindering our ability to serve customers effectively in the digital age. Our legacy Loan Origination System, NetOxygen, had been designed years earlier to handle complex mortgage and consumer loan applications. While it excelled at managing intricate underwriting processes, extensive paperwork, and multi-party approvals, it was fundamentally ill-suited for the fast-paced, streamlined experience that modern credit card applicants expected.</p><p>The most significant pain points included lengthy application processes where customers faced over 20 fields on a single page, causing mobile users to abandon their applications at a rate exceeding 60%. The approval process was painfully slow, with manual underwriting and batch bureau pulls taking minutes or even hours to complete. Our approval rates were stuck at approximately 23%, largely due to hard declines at the first sign of any risk factor, with no consideration for alternative products or tiered offerings.</p><p>Additionally, our system suffered from heavy IT dependencies, where each new card offer required weeks of backend coding and extensive legal review before it could be launched. This created significant bottlenecks and prevented us from responding quickly to market opportunities or customer needs.</p><p>We recognized the urgent need for a system that could deliver a fast, intuitive experience for everyday customers while still maintaining the rigorous standards required by regulators and our internal risk management teams.</p><h2>2. Understanding Our Users</h2><h3>2.1 Customer Survey & Interviews</h3><p>To better understand the challenges our customers faced, we conducted comprehensive research involving 150 survey respondents. The demographic breakdown revealed that 70% were mobile users while 30% preferred desktop applications. This mobile-first preference highlighted the critical importance of optimizing our application process for smaller screens and touch interfaces.</p><p>The survey results revealed the top customer frustrations: 53% cited long, complex forms as their primary concern, 40% expressed fear about potential negative impacts on their credit scores, and 35% were frustrated by unclear outcomes and lack of transparency in the decision-making process.</p><h3>2.2 User Personas</h3><p>Based on our research, we identified three primary user personas that represented our target customer base:</p><p><strong>Taylor, the First‑Time Applicant:</strong> A recent college graduate seeking a student rewards card but worried about the impact on their credit score. Taylor represents the cautious, first-time credit card applicant who needs clear guidance and reassurance throughout the process. They value educational content and transparent communication about how the application process works.</p><p><strong>Morgan, the Busy Professional:</strong> A working professional who strongly prefers mobile applications and expects to complete the entire process in under 5 minutes. Morgan represents the time-conscious segment of our customer base who prioritize efficiency and convenience above all else. They are likely to abandon applications that seem too lengthy or complicated.</p><p><strong>Alex, the Credit‑Builder Seeker:</strong> An individual with a thin credit file who needs a clear path to qualify for a secured card or other credit-building products. Alex represents customers who may not qualify for traditional credit cards but are actively working to build their credit history and need alternative options.</p><h2>3. Project Objectives</h2><ul><li><strong>Instant Eligibility:</strong> Deliver a \"yes/no\" check in under 30 seconds using a soft credit inquiry.</li><li><strong>Tiered Approvals:</strong> Move beyond simple pass/fail by grouping customers into Tiers A–D, so more people see relevant offers.</li><li><strong>Alternative Paths:</strong> Provide tailored fallback options (e.g., secured cards) instead of flat declines.</li><li><strong>Rapid Launches:</strong> Empower product teams to add or update card offers in under 5 days, with no coding.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Automate TILA, FCRA (U.S.) and FCAC (Canada) disclosures, plus PCI‑DSS data handling.</li></ul><h3>Success Metrics:</h3><ul><li>Approval rate ≥40%</li><li>Decision latency &lt;15 s</li><li>Application abandonment &lt;50%</li><li>Launch time &lt;5 days</li></ul><h2>4. High‑Level Solution</h2><p class='section-intro'>We designed a Modular Origination Platform that sits on top of NetOxygen, exposing new microservices to handle credit‑card‑specific logic—without disrupting existing mortgage/loan workflows.</p><ul><li><strong>Lightweight Front‑End App:</strong> Progressive web app (PWA) or iframe widget embeds on bank site/mobile app.</li><li><strong>Eligibility Gateway:</strong> JSON‑driven form schema, validates minimum criteria (age ≥18, residency).</li><li><strong>Soft Credit Pull:</strong> Pre‑qualification check, invisible to credit bureaus, yields a risk signal.</li><li><strong>Decision Engine:</strong> Combines soft pull data, bureau score (with a hard pull upon consent), and eight risk attributes into a Tier (A–D).</li><li><strong>Offer Personalization:</strong> CMS‑driven rules expose 1–3 tailored card offers, sorted by fit and issuer priority.</li><li><strong>Alternative Routes:</strong> Cross‑sell Engine proposes secured or credit‑builder products for Tiers C–D.</li><li><strong>E‑Sign & Disclosures:</strong> Docutech integration generates a one‑page summary and required legal PDF, with click‑to‑sign flow.</li><li><strong>LOS Integration:</strong> Approved apps push to NetOxygen via secure REST API; underwriter jobs created for exceptions.</li></ul><h2>5. Detailed Flow Walkthrough</h2><h3>5.1 Entry & Form Rendering</h3><ul><li><strong>Single‑Page Experience:</strong> On mobile, only 3 questions show initially (name, DOB, address).</li><li><strong>Smart Prefill:</strong> For existing customers, bank login preloads name and contact.</li><li><strong>Progressive Disclosure:</strong> Additional questions appear only if needed (e.g., income, employment).</li></ul><h3>5.2 Eligibility Gateway</h3><ul><li><strong>Age & Residency Check:</strong> Blocks under‑18 or out‑of‑jurisdiction upfront.</li><li><strong>Blacklist Filtering:</strong> Checks OFAC sanctions, internal fraud lists.</li><li><strong>Rate Limiting & CAPTCHA:</strong> Prevents abuse and bots.</li></ul><h3>5.3 Soft Credit Inquiry</h3><ul><li><strong>Risk Signals:</strong> From bureau's soft‑pull endpoint: credit score range, recent inquiries, utilization.</li><li><strong>No Score Impact:</strong> Customer peace‑of‑mind messaging: \"This won't affect your credit.\"</li></ul><h3>5.4 Decision Engine & Tiering</h3><p>To ensure consistency, transparency, and rapid decisioning, our Decision Engine follows a multi‐stage rule pipeline. Each stage applies distinct filters and scoring models, culminating in a final decision and suggested credit limit. Below are the detailed rules and logic:</p><h4>5.4.1 Preliminary Eligibility Filters</h4><h5>General Rules</h5><ul><li>Age Check: Must be ≥18 years old.</li><li>Residency Check: Valid residential address in the U.S. or Canada.</li><li>Blacklist Check: Screen against OFAC/PEP/Sanctions and bank's internal fraud watchlist.</li></ul><h5>Fraud Rules</h5><ul><li>Deceased Check: Auto‐reject if bureau or internal data indicates deceased.</li><li>Velocity Check: No more than 3 credit applications attempted in past 30 days.</li></ul><p>If any preliminary rule fails, the application is auto‐declined, and the customer sees an immediate, plain‐language explanation.</p><h4>5.4.2 Risk Attribute Scoring</h4><p>Once the application passes preliminary filters, eight key credit report metrics are extracted and scored individually on a 0–50 scale:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Average Age of Accounts</td><td>Measures credit maturity (longer = higher).</td></tr><tr><td>Inquiries in Last 6 Months (Excl. 14 Days)</td><td>Reflects recent credit‑seeking behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>Utilization Ratio on Revolving Trades</td><td>% of credit used; &gt;90% flags high‑risk usage.</td></tr><tr><td>Months Since Most Recent Delinquency</td><td>Recency of negative behavior; more months = higher score.</td></tr><tr><td>Major Derogatory/Public Records</td><td>Bankruptcy filings or legal actions captured.</td></tr><tr><td>Balance‑to‑Credit Ratio</td><td>Overall credit utilization across all trades.</td></tr><tr><td>Times 30+ Days Past Due (Last 2 Years)</td><td>Payment reliability metric.</td></tr><tr><td>Total Credit Limit on Recent Trades</td><td>Indicates recent credit expansion capacity.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Total Risk Score is the sum (max 400), then normalized to 0–100.</p><h4>5.4.3 Credit Tier Assignment</h4><p>The normalized risk score is combined with the applicant's FICO (or equivalent) score in a two‐dimensional matrix to assign a Tier (A–D):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Normalized Risk \\ FICO</th><th>≥800</th><th>760–799</th><th>740–759</th><th>720–739</th><th>&lt;720</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>80–100</td><td>A</td><td>A</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>60–79</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>40–59</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>D</td></tr><tr><td>0–39</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><span class='tier-badge tier-a'>Tier A</span> Prime applicants, highest likelihood of approval.</li><li><span class='tier-badge tier-b'>Tier B</span> Near‐prime, minor credit events.</li><li><span class='tier-badge tier-c'>Tier C</span> Thin file or moderate risk.</li><li><span class='tier-badge tier-d'>Tier D</span> Credit‑building segment, fallback to secured or alternate products.</li></ul><h4>5.4.4 Credit Limit Calculation</h4><p>For each Tier, a formula computes an Assigned Credit Limit:</p><pre><code>Assigned Limit = Min(\n  TierBaseAmount,\n  IncomePercentage × Monthly Income,\n  MaxExistingLine × HighestLinePercentage\n)</code></pre><table><thead><tr><th>Tier</th><th>TierBaseAmount</th><th>IncomePercentage</th><th>HighestLinePercentage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>$15,000</td><td>30%</td><td>150%</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>$12,000</td><td>20%</td><td>120%</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>$8,000</td><td>15%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>$5,000</td><td>10%</td><td>75%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This ensures limits are proportionate to income and existing credit capacity.</p><h4>5.4.5 Final Decision Mapping</h4><p>The final decision is determined by comparing the applicant's Tier and Assigned Limit against the selected card's required Tier and minimum limit:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decision Type</th><th>Condition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Auto Approve (AA)</td><td>Applicant Tier ≥ Card Tier AND Assigned Limit ≥ Card Min Limit</td></tr><tr><td>Recommended Approve (RA)</td><td>Applicant Tier ≥ Card Tier AND Assigned Limit &lt; Card Min Limit (referred to manual review)</td></tr><tr><td>Recommended Decline (RD)</td><td>Applicant Tier &lt; Card Tier AND Applicant Tier &gt; D (fallback offers available)</td></tr><tr><td>Auto Decline (AD)</td><td>Applicant Tier = D (Tier D sees fallback only)</td></tr><tr><td>Counteroffer</td><td>Alternative cards where Applicant Tier ≥ Alt Tier AND Assigned Limit ≥ Alt Min Limit</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If a counteroffer is accepted, the engine re‐evaluates the application using the new product criteria.</p><h3>5.5 Personalized Offers</h3><p><em>This section provides the framework for delivering tailored card offers based on customer tier and preferences.</em></p><h3>5.6 Consent & E‑Sign</h3><ul><li><strong>CMS Data Model:</strong> Card metadata (APR, annual fee, rewards) tagged by Tier, geography.</li><li><strong>Sorting Weights:</strong> Issuer margin, customer affinity, margin floor.</li><li><strong>Disclosure Draft:</strong> Summarized APR and fee bullets shown inline, with link to full PDF.</li><li><strong>E‑Sign Integration:</strong> User cannot move past the page and submit the application until he agrees to the consent.</li></ul><h3>5.7 LOS Integration & Fulfillment</h3><ul><li><strong>API Push:</strong> POST /applications to NetOxygen with idempotency key.</li><li><strong>Task Generation:</strong> Underwriter queues triggered for any non‑automated reviews.</li><li><strong>Webhook Sync:</strong> Listens for NetOxygen status updates (card printed, shipped), updates customer portal.</li></ul><h3>5.8 Cross‑Sell & Recovery</h3><ul><li><strong>Trigger Points:</strong> Any decline or manual‑review skip.</li><li><strong>Secured Card Partner API:</strong> Offers low‑deposit cards;

    "<h1>Ovis: A Comprehensive Fitness Solution Case Study</h1>\n\n<h2>1. Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>India's fitness ecosystem, while burgeoning, presented significant challenges for both fitness professionals and enthusiasts. The market was fragmented, with professionals often relying on disparate tools and social media platforms like Instagram for client management, diet planning, and progress tracking. This often led to inefficiencies, communication gaps, and a lack of a centralized, streamlined approach to fitness management. Simultaneously, fitness enthusiasts struggled with tracking their progress effectively, finding reliable guidance, and maintaining motivation within a noisy and often overwhelming online fitness landscape.</p>\n\n<p>This case study delves into Ovis, a fitness management application developed under Veefitt Ventures, a startup co-founded by a student at NITJ. The inspiration for Ovis emerged from a personal understanding of these market gaps and a passion for fitness. The co-founder, a fitness enthusiast themselves, recognized the need for a unified platform that could empower fitness professionals and provide a comprehensive solution for end-users to manage their fitness journeys. Ovis was conceived to bridge these gaps, offering a scalable and efficient platform to improve the processes and efficiency of fitness and health professionals, while simultaneously enhancing the experience for fitness enthusiasts.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>\n\n<p>Before Ovis, the fitness landscape in India was characterized by several critical inefficiencies and unmet needs. For fitness professionals, the primary challenge was the lack of a unified and efficient management system. Many trainers relied on a patchwork of tools, including social media platforms like Instagram for client acquisition and communication, spreadsheets for tracking client progress, and manual methods for scheduling and financial management. This fragmented approach led to significant time wastage, increased administrative burden, and a reduced capacity to scale their businesses. There was no single application that could comprehensively address the diverse management aspects required by online fitness professionals, from scheduling events and creating personalized diet and workout plans to handling finances, optimizing for search engines (SEO), hosting websites, and even providing a centralized learning hub.</p>\n\n<p>For fitness enthusiasts, the problems revolved around effective progress tracking and access to reliable, personalized guidance. While many individuals were keen on improving their fitness levels, they often found themselves navigating a confusing and overwhelming online fitness market. The sheer volume of information, often contradictory, made it difficult to discern credible advice from noise. Furthermore, existing solutions often failed to provide real-time progress tracking that could be easily shared with their trainers, hindering effective feedback loops and personalized adjustments to their fitness journeys. The absence of a dedicated platform meant that tracking macros, fitness plans, and goals was often a cumbersome and disconnected process.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, the core problem was a significant gap in the market for a comprehensive, integrated solution that could empower fitness professionals to operate more efficiently and effectively, while simultaneously providing fitness enthusiasts with the tools and support necessary to achieve their health and fitness goals. Existing platforms, including general social media and basic tracking apps, were inadequate as they lacked the specialized functionalities and integrated ecosystem required to address the unique needs of the fitness industry in India.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Role and Responsibilities</h2>\n\n<p>As a Growth and Business Product Manager for Ovis at Veefitt Ventures, my role was multifaceted and pivotal in bringing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to fruition. My responsibilities spanned across various critical areas, demonstrating a hands-on approach and a commitment to cross-functional collaboration. </p>\n\n<p>One of the primary contributions was in <strong>product strategy</strong>. This involved working closely with design, development, and branding teams to ensure consistency across the organization and to minimize communication gaps. A key focus was on developing features and a product that was inherently scalable, anticipating future growth and market demands. This strategic oversight ensured that Ovis was not just a functional application but a sustainable business solution.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond strategy, I was deeply involved in <strong>business development and growth</strong>. This included defining target customers, refining business plans, and establishing key metrics that aligned with the organization's vision and mission. My role extended to ideating various features specifically aimed at user acquisition and enhancing the customer experience (CX). This involved a continuous cycle of brainstorming and iteration to ensure the product resonated with its intended audience and provided tangible value.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of <strong>User Experience (UX) and branding</strong>, I played a crucial role in shaping the product's interface and overall identity. This encompassed designing basic wireframes, conducting usability testing, and actively contributing to the brand's visual and functional appeal. The goal was to create an intuitive and engaging platform that would be both effective for professionals and appealing to end-users.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, my responsibilities included <strong>team coordination and cross-functional collaboration</strong>.

Trainer Ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p>Ovis was designed not only as a comprehensive fitness solution for end-users but also as a powerful platform to empower fitness professionals. Recognizing the challenges trainers faced in managing their businesses and reaching a wider audience, Ovis provided a robust ecosystem that facilitated personal branding, client management, and monetization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Profile Customization and Personal Branding:</strong> Trainers on Ovis had the ability to create highly customized profiles. This included showcasing their expertise, specializations (e.g., Weight Loss, Cross Fit), years of experience, and certifications. The platform allowed trainers to upload a personal bio, share their philosophy, and highlight their unique approach to fitness. This emphasis on personal branding enabled trainers to establish their credibility and attract clients who resonated with their style and expertise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Client Management and Communication:</strong> The platform streamlined client management for trainers. They could easily track the progress of their clients, monitor their adherence to diet and workout plans, and communicate with them directly through the application. This centralized approach eliminated the need for trainers to juggle multiple communication channels and disparate tools, significantly improving their efficiency and client engagement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Content Creation and Sharing:</strong> Ovis empowered trainers to become content creators. They could publish articles and posts directly on their profiles, sharing valuable insights, tips, and educational content with their followers and clients. This not only positioned them as thought leaders but also provided an additional avenue for engagement and value delivery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Monetization Tools and Subscription Models:</strong> A critical aspect of the trainer ecosystem was the provision of robust monetization tools. Trainers could define and offer various plans and packages, such as Weight Loss and Cross Fit, with different pricing tiers (e.g., \u20b97000 for a basic plan including fitness and diet, and \u20b93999 for a diet plan with 1-on-1 consultancy). This allowed trainers to diversify their offerings and cater to a wider range of client needs and budgets. The platform facilitated the transaction process, making it easier for trainers to sell their services and manage their revenue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Social Proof and Transformation Stories:</strong> Ovis integrated features that allowed trainers to leverage social proof to attract new clients. They could showcase client reviews and testimonials directly on their profiles. More importantly, the platform supported the display of transformation stories, including before and after photos. This powerful visual evidence of their clients' success served as a compelling marketing tool, demonstrating the effectiveness of their coaching and building trust with potential clients.</p>\n\n<p>By providing this comprehensive suite of tools, Ovis created a thriving ecosystem for fitness professionals. It empowered them to build their brand, manage their clients efficiently, and monetize their expertise, ultimately enabling them to grow their businesses and make a greater impact in the fitness industry.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Business Model and Monetization</h2>\n\n<p>Ovis implemented a clear and multi-faceted business model primarily focused on empowering fitness professionals to monetize their services effectively, while also providing value to fitness enthusiasts.

These packages were structured to cater to different client needs and budget points. Examples include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Basic Fitness Plan:</strong> Priced at \u20b97000, this package likely included a comprehensive fitness plan and a diet plan. This indicates a premium offering for clients seeking a complete fitness solution.</li>\n<li><strong>Diet Plan with 1-on-1 Consultancy:</strong> Priced at \u20b93999, this package suggests a more focused offering for clients primarily interested in nutritional guidance and personalized consultation. This tiered pricing strategy allowed trainers to attract a wider range of clients.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This model suggests that Ovis likely took a commission or a subscription fee from trainers for using the platform to manage clients, offer services, and process payments. The platform acted as an intermediary, providing the infrastructure for trainers to build their online businesses. The ability for trainers to create and manage their own packages directly within the platform was a key enabler for their monetization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Revenue Strategy:</strong> The primary revenue streams for Ovis would have been derived from:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Trainer Subscriptions/Commissions:</strong> A percentage of the revenue generated by trainers through their package sales, or a recurring subscription fee for trainers to access the platform's advanced features and client management tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Premium Features for Trainers:</strong> Potential for additional revenue through premium features offered to trainers, such as enhanced analytics, advanced marketing tools, or priority support.</li>\n<li><strong>Advertising/Partnerships:</strong> While not explicitly detailed, future revenue could have been generated through partnerships with fitness brands, supplement companies, or advertising relevant products/services to the user base.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Insights from Early Adopters and Market Validation:</strong> The platform was built with a strong emphasis on user research and idea validation. The fact that trainers were able to offer and manage their packages implies that there was early market validation for this business model. The integration of client reviews and transformation stories further indicates that the platform was designed to facilitate social proof, which is crucial for the success of a service-based business model in the fitness industry. The ability to track client progress and showcase results directly contributed to the perceived value of the trainers' services, thereby supporting the monetization strategy.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, Ovis's business model was strategically aligned with empowering fitness professionals to effectively deliver and monetize their services, creating a symbiotic relationship where the platform's success was tied to the success of its trainers.</p>\n\n<h2>9. Growth Strategy</h2>\n\n<p>Ovis's growth strategy was intrinsically linked to its core value proposition: empowering fitness professionals and providing a comprehensive solution for fitness enthusiasts. While a dedicated 'Growth Strategy' section was not explicitly detailed, insights can be inferred from the product's design, features, and the stated problems it aimed to solve.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Go-to-Market Approach:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The initial go-to-market approach likely focused on attracting fitness professionals, as they were positioned as the primary users who would, in turn, bring in their clients (fitness enthusiasts) to the platform. The emphasis on features like trainer profiles, package customization, and monetization tools suggests a strategy of onboarding trainers first, who would then act as a channel for user acquisition. The problem statement highlights the inadequacy of existing platforms for trainers, indicating that Ovis aimed to fill a critical void for this segment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Community-Building Efforts:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The platform's design inherently supported community building, particularly around the trainer-client relationship. Features like direct messaging between trainers and clients and the ability for trainers to share articles and posts fostered engagement and a sense of community. The emphasis on transformation stories and client reviews also contributed to building a supportive and aspirational community around successful fitness journeys.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use of Digital Channels:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Given the nature of the product, digital channels would have been paramount for growth. The initial problem statement mentions the usage of Instagram as a primary means for trainers to sell their services, implying that Ovis aimed to provide a more structured and efficient digital platform. This suggests that digital marketing, social media engagement, and potentially search engine optimization (SEO) would have been key components of the growth strategy to reach both trainers and fitness enthusiasts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Analytics, KPIs, and Metrics:</strong></p>\n\n<p>While specific KPIs and metrics are not explicitly detailed, the emphasis on progress tracking for users and the mention of defining metrics consistent with the organization's vision and mission indicate a data-driven approach. Key metrics likely tracked would have included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Acquisition:</strong> Number of new trainers and fitness enthusiasts joining the platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Frequency of app usage, time spent on the platform, and interaction with features like progress tracking, diet plans, and communication tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Retention:</strong> Percentage of users and trainers who continued to use the platform over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Monetization:</strong> Revenue generated from trainer subscriptions and package sales.</li>\n<li><strong>Client Success:</strong> Tracking client transformations and achievements, which would also serve as a powerful marketing tool.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The focus on backend algorithm creation for the main goal trajectory further suggests an intention to leverage data for personalized user experiences and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the platform, which would directly contribute to user satisfaction and growth.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, Ovis's growth strategy appears to have been built on a foundation of solving real-world problems for its target users, fostering a strong community, and leveraging digital channels and data-driven insights to drive adoption and engagement.</p>\n\n<h2>10.

    "overview": "StreetKhana aimed to solve the discovery problem for street food enthusiasts by creating an AI-powered platform that connects users with local vendors based on preferences, location, and real-time availability.",
    "problem": "India is home to an estimated 2 million street food vendors, offering a rich and diverse culinary experience across cities and towns. Despite the widespread love for street food, people often struggle to discover the best and most hygienic options nearby—especially when craving local specialties or traveling to a new city. This highlights a significant discovery gap in the street food ecosystem. To bridge this gap, we envision building a street food finder app that enables users to seamlessly explore, locate, and engage with top-rated street vendors based on their location, preferences, and real-time availability. To develop an outstanding product that street food lovers genuinely value, we must first understand the market landscape—mapping key players, vendors, and competitors, and assessing current solutions. From there, we will form hypotheses around the ideal product experience, conduct both user and competitor research to validate assumptions, and identify distinct user segments along with their pain points. Based on user personas, we’ll design and prioritize features, define the MVP scope, outline a high-level system design, and create wireframes with intuitive UI/UX. We will map the end-to-end user journey, define measurable success metrics including a north star and supporting KPIs, and structure a viable monetization plan. Finally, we’ll identify potential risks—such as vendor onboarding challenges or user trust—and propose mitigation strategies to ensure the long-term success of the product.",
