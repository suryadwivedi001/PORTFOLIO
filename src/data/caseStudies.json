    "overview": "StreetKhana aimed to solve the discovery problem for street food enthusiasts by creating an AI-powered platform that connects users with local vendors based on preferences, location, and real-time availability.",
    "problem": "India is home to an estimated 2 million street food vendors, offering a rich and diverse culinary experience across cities and towns. Despite the widespread love for street food, people often struggle to discover the best and most hygienic options nearby—especially when craving local specialties or traveling to a new city. This highlights a significant discovery gap in the street food ecosystem. To bridge this gap, we envision building a street food finder app that enables users to seamlessly explore, locate, and engage with top-rated street vendors based on their location, preferences, and real-time availability. To develop an outstanding product that street food lovers genuinely value, we must first understand the market landscape—mapping key players, vendors, and competitors, and assessing current solutions. From there, we will form hypotheses around the ideal product experience, conduct both user and competitor research to validate assumptions, and identify distinct user segments along with their pain points. Based on user personas, we’ll design and prioritize features, define the MVP scope, outline a high-level system design, and create wireframes with intuitive UI/UX. We will map the end-to-end user journey, define measurable success metrics including a north star and supporting KPIs, and structure a viable monetization plan. Finally, we’ll identify potential risks—such as vendor onboarding challenges or user trust—and propose mitigation strategies to ensure the long-term success of the product.",

Each stage applies distinct filters and scoring models, culminating in a final decision and suggested credit limit. Below are the detailed rules and logic:</p><h4>4.4.1 Preliminary Eligibility Filters</h4><h5>General Rules</h5><ul><li>Age Check: Must be ≥18 years old.</li><li>Residency Check: Valid residential address in the U.S. or Canada.</li><li>Blacklist Check: Screen against OFAC/PEP/Sanctions and bank's internal fraud watchlist.</li></ul><h5>Fraud Rules</h5><ul><li>Deceased Check: Auto‐reject if bureau or internal data indicates deceased.</li><li>Velocity Check: No more than 3 credit applications attempted in past 30 days.</li></ul><p>If any preliminary rule fails, the application is auto‐declined, and the customer sees an immediate, plain‐language explanation.</p><h4>4.4.2 Risk Attribute Scoring</h4><p>Once the application passes preliminary filters, eight key credit report metrics are extracted and scored individually on a 0–50 scale:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Average Age of Accounts</td><td>Measures credit maturity (longer = higher).</td></tr><tr><td>Inquiries in Last 6 Months (Excl. 14 Days)</td><td>Reflects recent credit‑seeking behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>Utilization Ratio on Revolving Trades</td><td>% of credit used; &gt;90% flags high‑risk usage.</td></tr><tr><td>Months Since Most Recent Delinquency</td><td>Recency of negative behavior; more months = higher score.</td></tr><tr><td>Major Derogatory/Public Records</td><td>Bankruptcy filings or legal actions captured.</td></tr><tr><td>Balance‑to‑Credit Ratio</td><td>Overall credit utilization across all trades.</td></tr><tr><td>Times 30+ Days Past Due (Last 2 Years)</td><td>Payment reliability metric.</td></tr><tr><td>Total Credit Limit on Recent Trades</td><td>Indicates recent credit expansion capacity.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Total Risk Score is the sum (max 400), then normalized to 0–100.</p><h4>4.4.3 Credit Tier Assignment</h4><p>The normalized risk score is combined with the applicant's FICO (or equivalent) score in a two‐dimensional matrix to assign a Tier (A–D):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Normalized Risk \\ FICO</th><th>≥800</th><th>760–799</th><th>740–759</th><th>720–739</th><th>&lt;720</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>80–100</td><td>A</td><td>A</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>60–79</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>40–59</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>D</td></tr><tr><td>0–39</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><span class='tier-badge tier-a'>Tier A</span> Prime applicants, highest likelihood of approval.</li><li><span class='tier-badge tier-b'>Tier B</span> Near‐prime, minor credit events.</li><li><span class='tier-badge tier-c'>Tier C</span> Thin file or moderate risk.</li><li><span class='tier-badge tier-d'>Tier D</span> Credit‑building segment, fallback to secured or alternate products.</li></ul><h4>4.4.4 Credit Limit Calculation</h4><p>For each Tier, a formula computes an Assigned Credit Limit:</p><pre><code>Assigned Limit = Min(\n  TierBaseAmount,\n  IncomePercentage × Monthly Income,\n  MaxExistingLine × HighestLinePercentage\n)</code></pre><table><thead><tr><th>Tier</th><th>TierBaseAmount</th><th>IncomePercentage</th><th>HighestLinePercentage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>$15,000</td><td>30%</td><td>150%</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>$12,000</td><td>20%</td><td>120%</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>$8,000</td><td>15%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>$5,000</td><td>10%</td><td>75%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This ensures limits are proportionate to income and existing credit capacity.</p><h4>4.4.5 Final Decision Mapping</h4><p>The final decision is determined by comparing the applicant's Tier and Assigned Limit against the selected card's required Tier and minimum limit:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decision Type</th><th>Condition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Auto Approve (AA)</td><td>Applicant Tier ≥ Card Tier AND Assigned Limit ≥ Card Min Limit</td></tr><tr><td>Recommended Approve (RA)</td><td>Applicant Tier ≥ Card Tier AND Assigned Limit &lt; Card Min Limit (referred to manual review)</td></tr><tr><td>Recommended Decline (RD)</td><td>Applicant Tier &lt; Card Tier AND Applicant Tier &gt; D (fallback offers available)</td></tr><tr><td>Auto Decline (AD)</td><td>Applicant Tier = D (Tier D sees fallback only)</td></tr><tr><td>Counteroffer</td><td>Alternative cards where Applicant Tier ≥ Alt Tier AND Assigned Limit ≥ Alt Min Limit</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If a counteroffer is accepted, the engine re‐evaluates the application using the new product criteria.</p><h3>4.5 Personalized Offers</h3><p><em>This section provides the framework for delivering tailored card offers based on customer tier and preferences.</em></p><h3>4.6 Consent &amp; E‑Sign</h3><ul><li><strong>CMS Data Model:</strong> Card metadata (APR, annual fee, rewards) tagged by Tier, geography.</li><li><strong>Sorting Weights:</strong> Issuer margin, customer affinity, margin floor.</li><li><strong>Disclosure Draft:</strong> Summarized APR and fee bullets shown inline, with link to full PDF.</li><li><strong>E‑Sign Integration:</strong> User cannot move past the page and submit the application until he agrees to the consent.</li></ul><h3>4.7 LOS Integration &amp;
