      <h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
      <p class='section-intro'>Our bank's long‑standing Loan Origination System (NetOxygen) was designed for mortgages and consumer loans, but it wasn't built for credit cards or modern digital channels.</p>
      <p>The existing system presented several critical challenges that were hindering our ability to serve customers effectively in the digital age. Our legacy Loan Origination System, NetOxygen, had been designed years earlier to handle complex mortgage and consumer loan applications. While it excelled at managing intricate underwriting processes, extensive paperwork, and multi-party approvals, it was fundamentally ill-suited for the fast-paced, streamlined experience that modern credit card applicants expected.</p>
      <p>The most significant pain points included lengthy application processes where customers faced over 20 fields on a single page, causing mobile users to abandon their applications at a rate exceeding 60%. The approval process was painfully slow, with manual underwriting and batch bureau pulls taking minutes or even hours to complete. Our approval rates were stuck at approximately 23%, largely due to hard declines at the first sign of any risk factor, with no consideration for alternative products or tiered offerings.</p>
      <p>Additionally, our system suffered from heavy IT dependencies, where each new card offer required weeks of backend coding and extensive legal review before it could be launched. This created significant bottlenecks and prevented us from responding quickly to market opportunities or customer needs.</p>
      <p>We recognized the urgent need for a system that could deliver a fast, intuitive experience for everyday customers while still maintaining the rigorous standards required by regulators and our internal risk management teams.</p>
      <h2>2. Understanding Our Users</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Customer Survey & Interviews</h3>
      <p>To better understand the challenges our customers faced, we conducted comprehensive research involving 150 survey respondents. The demographic breakdown revealed that 70% were mobile users while 30% preferred desktop applications. This mobile-first preference highlighted the critical importance of optimizing our application process for smaller screens and touch interfaces.</p>
      <p>The survey results revealed the top customer frustrations: 53% cited long, complex forms as their primary concern, 40% expressed fear about potential negative impacts on their credit scores, and 35% were frustrated by unclear outcomes and lack of transparency in the decision-making process.</p>
      <h3>2.2 User Personas</h3>
      <p>Based on our research, we identified three primary user personas that represented our target customer base:</p>
      <p><strong>Taylor, the First‑Time Applicant:</strong> A recent college graduate seeking a student rewards card but worried about the impact on their credit score. Taylor represents the cautious, first-time credit card applicant who needs clear guidance and reassurance throughout the process. They value educational content and transparent communication about how the application process works.</p>
      <p><strong>Morgan, the Busy Professional:</strong> A working professional who strongly prefers mobile applications and expects to complete the entire process in under 5 minutes. Morgan represents the time-conscious segment of our customer base who prioritize efficiency and convenience above all else. They are likely to abandon applications that seem too lengthy or complicated.</p>
      <p><strong>Alex, the Credit‑Builder Seeker:</strong> An individual with a thin credit file who needs a clear path to qualify for a secured card or other credit-building products. Alex represents customers who may not qualify for traditional credit cards but are actively working to build their credit history and need alternative options.</p>
      <h2>3. Project Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Instant Eligibility:</strong> Deliver a \"yes/no\" check in under 30 seconds using a soft credit inquiry.</li>
         <li><strong>Tiered Approvals:</strong> Move beyond simple pass/fail by grouping customers into Tiers A–D, so more people see relevant offers.</li>
         <li><strong>Alternative Paths:</strong> Provide tailored fallback options (e.g., secured cards) instead of flat declines.</li>
         <li><strong>Rapid Launches:</strong> Empower product teams to add or update card offers in under 5 days, with no coding.</li>
         <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Automate TILA, FCRA (U.S.) and FCAC (Canada) disclosures, plus PCI‑DSS data handling.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Success Metrics:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Approval rate ≥40%</li>
         <li>Decision latency &lt;15 s</li>
         <li>Application abandonment &lt;50%</li>
         <li>Launch time &lt;5 days</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>4. High‑Level Solution</h2>
      <p class='section-intro'>We designed a Modular Origination Platform that sits on top of NetOxygen, exposing new microservices to handle credit‑card‑specific logic—without disrupting existing mortgage/loan workflows.</p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Lightweight Front‑End App:</strong> Progressive web app (PWA) or iframe widget embeds on bank site/mobile app.</li>
         <li><strong>Eligibility Gateway:</strong> JSON‑driven form schema, validates minimum criteria (age ≥18, residency).</li>
         <li><strong>Soft Credit Pull:</strong> Pre‑qualification check, invisible to credit bureaus, yields a risk signal.</li>
         <li><strong>Decision Engine:</strong> Combines soft pull data, bureau score (with a hard pull upon consent), and eight risk attributes into a Tier (A–D).</li>
         <li><strong>Offer Personalization:</strong> CMS‑driven rules expose 1–3 tailored card offers, sorted by fit and issuer priority.</li>
         <li><strong>Alternative Routes:</strong> Cross‑sell Engine proposes secured or credit‑builder products for Tiers C–D.</li>
         <li><strong>E‑Sign & Disclosures:</strong> Docutech integration generates a one‑page summary and required legal PDF, with click‑to‑sign flow.</li>
         <li><strong>LOS Integration:</strong> Approved apps push to NetOxygen via secure REST API; underwriter jobs created for exceptions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>5. Detailed Flow Walkthrough</h2>
      <h3>5.1 Entry & Form Rendering</h3>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Single‑Page Experience:</strong> On mobile, only 3 questions show initially (name, DOB, address).</li>
         <li><strong>Smart Prefill:</strong> For existing customers, bank login preloads name and contact.</li>
         <li><strong>Progressive Disclosure:</strong> Additional questions appear only if needed (e.g., income, employment).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>5.2 Eligibility Gateway</h3>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Age & Residency Check:</strong> Blocks under‑18 or out‑of‑jurisdiction upfront.</li>
         <li><strong>Blacklist Filtering:</strong> Checks OFAC sanctions, internal fraud lists.</li>
         <li><strong>Rate Limiting & CAPTCHA:</strong> Prevents abuse and bots.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>5.3 Soft Credit Inquiry</h3>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Risk Signals:</strong> From bureau's soft‑pull endpoint: credit score range, recent inquiries, utilization.</li>
         <li><strong>No Score Impact:</strong> Customer peace‑of‑mind messaging: \"This won't affect your credit.\"</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>5.4 Decision Engine & Tiering</h3>
      <p>To ensure consistency, transparency, and rapid decisioning, our Decision Engine follows a multi‐stage rule pipeline. Each stage applies distinct filters and scoring models, culminating in a final decision and suggested credit limit. Below are the detailed rules and logic:</p>
      <h4>5.4.1 Preliminary Eligibility Filters</h4>
      <h5>General Rules</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>Age Check: Must be ≥18 years old.</li>
         <li>Residency Check: Valid residential address in the U.S. or Canada.</li>
         <li>Blacklist Check: Screen against OFAC/PEP/Sanctions and bank's internal fraud watchlist.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Fraud Rules</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>Deceased Check: Auto‐reject if bureau or internal data indicates deceased.</li>
         <li>Velocity Check: No more than 3 credit applications attempted in past 30 days.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If any preliminary rule fails, the application is auto‐declined, and the customer sees an immediate, plain‐language explanation.</p>
      <h4>5.4.2 Risk Attribute Scoring</h4>
      <p>Once the application passes preliminary filters, eight key credit report metrics are extracted and scored individually on a 0–50 scale:</p>
      <table>
         <thead>
            <tr>
               <th>Attribute</th>
               <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
         </thead>
         <tbody>
            <tr>
               <td>Average Age of Accounts</td>
               <td>Measures credit maturity (longer = higher).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>Inquiries in Last 6 Months (Excl. 14 Days)</td>
               <td>Reflects recent credit‑seeking behavior.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>Months Since Most Recent Delinquency</td>
               <td>Recency of negative behavior; more months = higher score.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>Major Derogatory/Public Records</td>
               <td>Bankruptcy filings or legal actions captured.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>Balance‑to‑Credit Ratio</td>
               <td>Overall credit utilization across all trades.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>Times 30+ Days Past Due (Last 2 Years)</td>
               <td>Payment reliability metric.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>Total Credit Limit on Recent Trades</td>
               <td>Indicates recent credit expansion capacity.</td>
            </tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The Total Risk Score is the sum (max 400), then normalized to 0–100.</p>
      <h4>5.4.3 Credit Tier Assignment</h4>
      <p>The normalized risk score is combined with the applicant's FICO (or equivalent) score in a two‐dimensional matrix to assign a Tier (A–D):</p>
      <table>
         <thead>
            <tr>
               <th>Normalized Risk \\ FICO</th>
